# Part-III-essay
A place to put my Master's dissertation-style essay titled "Graphical Modelling for High-Dimensional Data", written in early 2017.

This essay reviews some recent developments in the field of graphical modelling and then compares them based on computational efficiency, accuracy and - arguably the main focus - flexibility in the scope of distributions these methods are valid for. 

I experimented in R with each of these methods and produced numerical results to back up my findings. These are provided towards the end of the paper (after the technical review). Each method was tested against each other to see which performs best amongst a variety of synthetic data scenarios.
