# Part-III-essay
A place to put my Master's dissertation-style essay titled "Graphical Modelling for High-Dimensional Data", written in early 2017.

This essay reviews some recent developments in the field of graphical modelling and then compares them based on computational efficiency, accuracy and - arguably the main focus - flexibility in the scope of distributions these methods are valid for. 

Numerical results are provided towards the end of the paper (after the technical review). I tested each method reviewed against each other to see which performed best amongst a variety of synthetic data scenarios.
